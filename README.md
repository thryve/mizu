usage:
`python3 app.py [--email email] [--id id]`

example:
`python3 app.py --email foobar@gmail.com`
`python3 app.py --id 12345`

The point of this to easily transfer production data into local without the tedious
importing and exporting of CSV's. Used for seeing a customer's data locally and in the
event of a customer support ticket and they can't see a certain page for whatever error.

The code doesn't look the best and there might be bugs,
but I just wanted to whip this up because I was sick and tired
of manually transfering customer data over.
